**Project Problem statement:**

create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. 
Rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.
Specifically, in this project you should:
• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.
• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

introduction 

For this problem I am anaysing a sample 2000 Irish men and women. I am going to Synthesise their height , weight, gender and ethinicity. The hight of a population can be predicted using normal distribution. Weight slightly deviate from the normal distribution and predicting this is a bigger problem and it's outside the scope of this class hence I am unsing a normal distribution. 

I am assuming the male to female ratio to be 50%/50%.

Assumptions:
Hight and weight disribution is normal disribution
hight standard deviaiton
weight standard deviaiton

**How to run the file:**
1.  Open Task 2020.ipynb in Jupyterlab or Jupyter notebook .
2. click the Kernel button and select Restart & Run All. 
3. when the pop window appear select Restart and Run All Cells.
